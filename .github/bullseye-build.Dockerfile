# Builds the release binary and the Linux wheel in Debian 11 (bullseye, glibc 2.31)
# so they run on a broad range of Linux — RHEL/Alma 9 (2.34), Ubuntu 20.04+,
# Debian 11+ — instead of the runner's glibc. Driven by release.yml and
# python-wheels.yml through `docker build --target <x>-out --output type=local`:
# a `docker run` with apt inside does not work under the runner's docker (apt's
# lock dirs are not writable there), a build does.
#
# bullseye is past its security support and deb.debian.org no longer serves its
# security pool; the image is built from snapshot.debian.org, whose lines sit
# commented in its sources.list, and those still have every package at the exact
# version the image expects (clang pins libc6-i386 to the image's libc).
